## Description
- A program meant to set up an api for social media that tracks users, user thoughts, user reactions to thoughts, and connects to friends they meet on the application. 


- This project taught me more about api routes, how to use mongoDB, and moongoose.
- This project also taught me a little more on how to create routes in a cleaner and more modular way.



## Installation
- copy the code from github, instal mongoDB, mongoose, and mongoDBCompass. I also used Express in this project.


## Usage
- to start the program type node index.js within the terminal. You will also need to use mongoDBCompass and a program like insomnia to use the routes since there is no front end. 


## Tests
- none
